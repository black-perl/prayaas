**Prayaas** is an event based on building database systems that can scale and handle *big data* using efficient methods. In this implementation, **Python** is used with **SQLite3** providing high-speed querying and efficient, robust read and write operations.

SQLite3 was chosen because of its high scalability(high volume size upto 140TB!), lowest querying times, platform independence, compact size and zero config headaches :)

The benchmarks for SQLite3 can be seen here:
